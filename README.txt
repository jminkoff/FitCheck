In using our program, we used many different techniques. In order to run the finished product, run “display.py” to see the output. Additionally, run the OpenPoseImage.py for pose estimation. Much of the help from that file came from here:

In addition, the TPS algorithms codes are found in tps.py if you want to run it yourself individually. The other modules are used for pre preprocessing or post processing of the image. For TPS, much of our information came here:
